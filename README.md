## Welcome

Hello! Welcome to the ADAnswersBot codebase. You may have noticed that the code is terrible. This is fine, because the bot works. However, here are some guidelines for contributing and how to contribute.

## Issues

The issues tab is my best friend for keeping track of what to do for each bot version. If you have anything you want to see but don't want to code it yourself, make an issue for it!

## How to contribute

Address the readme found [here](https://github.com/earthernsence/ADAnswers-Bot/blob/main/src/commands/README.md).

## Guidelines

When contributing, be sure to be serious with your suggestion. This is a real, live, bot being used in a server with thousands of people!

### Code quality

Install an ESLint extension to be able to conform to style guidelines.

### Functions

When adding new functions, PLEASE use functions.js! You will need to add them as an export to the `module.exports` line, but it should be relatively straightforward. Also make sure to use JSDoc to document them. If you're unaware of what JSDoc is, see the next section.

## Other important information

### IDE and other important things for it

[**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Allows you to install these extensions and I know for a fact it will work. VSC is a generally good starting IDE. However, some people may prefer Visual Studio or maybe Atom. I have no idea about if Atom has these extensions or not, which is why I recommend VSC.

[**ESLint**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint):
ESLint will take the two ESLint files in this repo and use them as the settings. Install it globally; it will improve any JS you do, as long as you have the ESLint files for it.

[**GitLens**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens):
I only recommend having GitLens to see who worked in what files when. It is updated on commit.

[**GitHub Desktop**](https://desktop.github.com/): For contributing. It is (generally) easier to make new branches/commits/PRs and whatnot. However, if you are well versed in Git, unlike myself, you can get away with using it.

### Feel free to reach out to me!

I made this mess of a codebase, and I'm glad you're frolicking in it! But if you're ever confused on what to do, please get out to me on discord @earth#1337. I would be happy to help! I may not help for a few hours at a time due to schooling etc. but I will get back to you first chance I get!
