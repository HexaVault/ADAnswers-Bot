Whenever you create a new Reality, you will choose (or be given) a new Glyph. These Glyphs provide powerful bonuses, but only while they are equipped.

These glyphs appear in the Glyph tab, in a massive grid called the Glyph Inventory. At the top of the Glyph tab is a series of 3-5 circles, which represent your equipped glyphs. 

On your first Reality, you are guaranteed to receive a ${isADServer ? "<:glyph_power:586607087744843776>" : "**Ω**"} Power Glyph that raises all Antimatter Dimensions to a small power. It is recommended that you equip it immediately.`;

    a) Double click the glyph in your inventory. Your glyph inventory is in the lower right corner of the Glyph tab. Go there, find a glyph (such as the power glyph you got from your first Reality), and double click it. 
    
    b) Click and drag the glyph to a slot. At the top of the screen will be 3-5 slots (depending on Reality Upgrades) that you can fill with glyphs. Click on a glyph, hold down the mouse button, and drag it up to one of the empty slots. Attempting to place a glyph in a filled slot will require you to reset the Reality. 
    
To unequip a glyph, you have to click on the "Unequip Glyphs on Reality" button below the equipped glyphs. Then, you have to either complete your reality, or reset it using the "Start this Reality over" button. 

Glyphs that are not equipped have no effect.`;

The rarity of a glyph is given as a percentage, ranging from 0% to 100%. At first, this value will be determined solely by RNGesus. Later on, there will be ways to improve your odds; the first improvement comes as a result of the achievement "Perks of Living", which increases the rarity of all future Glyphs by 1%. 

This rarity is wholly independent from level, and is determined from the moment that you create a new Reality, so you can't savescum them. Your first ever glyph has a rarity of 20%. 

At certain rarity thresholds, the color of your glyph will change. These colors are as follows:

    - Common: 0 - 20%, White
    - Uncommon: 20 - 40%, Green
    - Rare: 40 - 60%, Light Blue
    - Epic: 60 - 70%, Purple
    - Legendary, 70 - 80%, Orange

The level of a glyph is calculuated based on 3 (or 4) resources you collect during a Reality. These resources are Eternity Points, Replicanti, and Dilated Time. When you purchase the Reality Upgrade "Measure of Forever", Eternities also become a part of the equation. Only the highest amount reached in a Reality is considered.

Initially, these factors are as follows: 
Eternity Points: \`0.016 * log(EP)^0.5\`
Replicanti: \`0.025 * log(Rep)^0.4\`
Dilated Time: \`0.025 * log(DT)^1.3\`
Eternities: \`0.450 * log(Eternities)^0.5\` (if unlocked)

All of the above factors are then multiplied together. Finally, other bonuses (Such as the number of Reality Upgrade rows you have completed, or achievements such as Royal Flush) are added, and that value, rounded down, is your final Glyph level. 

All this information can be found under "Glyph Level Factors" in the Glyph tab. `;

Glyph Sacrifice allows you to get rid of glyphs that you no longer need, in exchange for a permanent boost based on the glyph's type. Each glyph has a "sacrifice score", based on its level and rarity; when you destroy a glyph, this sacrifice score is added to your total glyph sacrifice for that type.`;

This is a unique, one-of-a-kind glyph that simply exists to bring you joy. 

It also records the amount of Eternity Points you gained on your first Reality. It allows some of the older AD players to flex a little.

Destroying it gives no benefits, so why would you want to?`;
