  info: `Teresa, the first Celestial, is unlocked by obtaining all Reality Upgrades (Achievement 147). The main screen features a bar with a "Pour RM" button, allowing you to deposit, or "pour", RM into a container for a Reality Machine multiplier. Once poured, RM cannot be retrieved. Unlocking Teresa's Reality requires reaching 1e14 RM inside the container. Completing Teresa's Reality multiplies Glyph Sacrifice based on antimatter gained during the run. However, progress requires continuous pouring of RM. Reaching 1e21 RM in the container unlocks the next Celestial. Teresa's Reality can be repeated, with stronger rewards obtained by achieving higher antimatter amounts on subsequent runs.`,
